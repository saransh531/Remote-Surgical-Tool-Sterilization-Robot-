# Remote-Surgical-Tool-Sterilization-Robot-

Used Python to program a robot to pick up and move containers containing surgical instruments into an autoclave so that they can be sterilized. The robot's movements are dictated by a muscle sensor that is hooked up to the bicep of the user and interfaced with a microcomputer.
